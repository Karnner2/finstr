Description: Data structures and functions for manipulating financial
    statements. Using parsed XBRL data and validating statement consistency.
    Merging statements from different periods or different statement types.
    Calculating custom financial ratios and creating custom statements
    by aggregating financial categories. (Updated to use reshape2 rather 
    than spread so that the financial statements merge correctly without 
    fail. Additionally see companion update to XBRL package (XBRL-upd) which
    corrects the http/https error for schema download. https://github.com/Karnner2/XBRL-upd)
